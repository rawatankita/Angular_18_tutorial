Setup questions:

âœ” Which stylesheet format would you like to use? CSS [ https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS ] âœ” Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)? No ? Do you want to create a 'zoneless' application without zone.js (Developer Preview)?

Answer:

Great question! A zoneless Angular application is one that runs without zone.js, which traditionally handles change detection in Angular. This new approach is part of Angularâ€™s Developer Preview and aims to improve performance, debugging, and compatibility.

ðŸš€ Why Go Zoneless?
Better performance: Avoids unnecessary change detection cycles.

Smaller bundle size: Removes zone.js from your build.

Improved debugging: Cleaner stack traces.

Future-ready: Avoids monkey-patching browser APIs, which can break with newer features.
